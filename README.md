What is Safe Mindspace?

In the midst of the pandemic, many of us are experiencing an overwhelming amount of stress. Countless days of sitting in front of our computers, with deadlines piling up, and not knowing what lies ahead of us. Most importantly, the pandemic not only distanced us from others, but distracted us from caring for our own health as well.

At Safe Mindspace, we hope to provide a healing haven for those who wish to slow down, tackle tasks one by one, destress, and unwind. Check out our activities page to find things you can do to relax and destress, or head over to our tools page to utililze our web tools!
